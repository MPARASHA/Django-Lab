Q2. The install worked successfully! Congratulations!

Q3. at /polls it shows Hello, world. You're at the polls index. 
    at / it shows error Page not found (404)

Q4. Django migrations update's the database schema by notifying it about new models/ updates in 
    the existing ones. Migrations are like the git for django database. They help in keeping track 
    of the changes in the database schema.

Q5. After logging into the django administration site. I see two sets of models. One is for AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION,
    and the other one is for our polls application. I see the Questions and Choices models. 
    There are buttons to add and modify these models.

Q6. /polls/38/ You're looking at question 38.
    /polls/38/results You're looking at the results of question 38.
    /polls/38/vote You're voting on question 38.

    it gives error Page not found (404) when you don't give a number.
    changing <int:question_id> to <str:question_id> will allow accepting strings

Q7. Hardcoding url's makes it hard to maintain and update the app. Every small change in the
    url schema means every hardcoded url needs to be changed.

Q8. Generic views help avoid writing repetitive code for common situations. They provide already implemented
    set of views like Detail, List etc which are commonly used in creating web apps. 

    You should use generic views as a boilerplate code to avoid writing repetitive code for similar views.
    You should not use generic view if the view you need very specific and creating them by extending generic views is cumbersome.
